# F# COIN CHANGE KATA WITH PROPERTY-BASED TESTING
_For the attention of Codit_

The one way to get an expert in a topic is to practice; and Programming Katas are a very good approach to keep practicing your programming skills.
In this post, I will solve the Coin Change Kata with F# and use Property-Based Testing (with FsCheck) to drive the design.
This was for me a lesson in writing properties and not so much solving the kata, but because it was a fun exercise and I miss sometimes concrete Property-Based Testing examples; I thought it would be useful to share my code with you.
If you havenâ€™t any experience with Property-Based Testing or F#, I recommend you look first at those topics.
